The Primer is Portland Code School's foundational course. Whether you're interested in kickstarting a career in web development or just augmenting your technical skills, the Primer will equip you with hands-on experience working with the web's core technologies: HTML and CSS, and tools indispensable to modern web development: the Unix command line, Git, and GitHub. 

Students with little or no experience coding but interested in our front-end and full-stack JavaScript courses are advised to start with the Primer.

There are no shortcuts to mastery, but you don't have to go it alone. Bring your energy and hunger and we'll get you started on the right path.
