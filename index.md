The Web Development Foundations class is Portland Code School's introduction to web development. It provides you with the starting skills to build modern websites. Whether you're interested in kickstarting a career in web development or just augmenting your technical skills, this class will equip you with hands-on experience working with the web's core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as tools indispensable to modern web development: the Unix command line, Git, and GitHub. 


The first four weeks that gets you started in the Portland Code School learning environment at low cost. Students spend 6 hours per week in the classroom. It requires 1 hour of homework for every class hour for a total weekly commitment of 12 hours. Open lab time and teaching assistants are available to all students. 

The second 4 weeks builds first four to prepare students for the following work:

* Internship at a web development or creative design studio
* Creation of simple websites for small businesses or individuals
* Participation in further Portland Code School classes
 
You can take either the first four weeks as "The Primer" if you are just curious.

Students with little or no experience coding but interested in our Front-End and full-stack JavaScript courses are advised to start with the Extended Primer.

There are no shortcuts to mastery, but you don't have to go it alone. Bring your energy and hunger and we'll get you started on the right path.
