* Understand the difference between `<section>` and `<div>`.
* Apply a box shadow, rounded corners, and text shadow.
* Know transitions and animations and where to apply them.
* Know what vendor prefixes are, why they are used.
* Understand how box-sizing changes the box model.


Exercise (Optional)
====================
