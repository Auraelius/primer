Part 0 - set up the assignment
----------------------------------

### Steps
0. Pick your team: Pick a partner to work with and make a plan of action to complete the first step of this project before you leave class.
0. As a team, choose a previously worked on website to use for this project.  You should use one of the sites you made for a massage therapist.
0. Make a repository and establish a remote on github.com. This should be review
0. Create a gh-pages branch both locally and on github.com to set up web hosting
0. Work on the master branch unless you are deploying via the gh-pages branch

0. Merge from master to gh-pages and push to publish your file to the web
0. Verify that your file is available

Part 1 - Start with the Bootstrap default theme
----------------------------------
0. Download bootstrap in one of the following ways:
* [source code](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) and start reading the documentation

* Set the Bootstrap cdn in your code like we did in class from codepen
0. Copy the basic template code from [Bootstrap getting-started](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) and paste it into a new html file.  Make sure the css and javaScript links to this html page
